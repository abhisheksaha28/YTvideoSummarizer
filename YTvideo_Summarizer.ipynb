              "'[\" i\\'m aryan and today i\\'m going to take you through a project that i\\'ve made which i call youtube summarizer . The extension is a chrome extension and you can go to any youtube video and it summarizes the youtube video for you in very few lines so you don\\'t have to sit and watch through the whole video . The design may not look the best you may want to tweak the colors the styling that\\'s all up to you .\", \" The way this project is structured is there is an API a summarized summarizer API that i\\'ve created in python and this chrome extension is created using html and javascript and whenever we run the summarize button it calls the summarizer api which is in python . The summarizer model we\\'ll be using is provided to us by hugging face transformers .\", \" This is basically what the these two are the extension itself whereas this is the API let\\'s start with the API so app.py is the api that summarizes the whatever text you give to it . Then we have an extension folder and in the extension folder you will find everything that is needed for the chrome extension itself .\", \\' The first thing we do is app equal to flask name this is just to set up the flask app . There are different kinds of requests there are get requests get requests post request push requests a put request . Pipeline is a method of the transformers module that helps us implement models they have summarization .\\', \" The first function i\\'m defining is a summary API so url equal to request request is something we\\'ve imported from flask and request is nothing but you know the the the url it helps us perform functions using the url so the request that we send to flask is the request . In our case we are not editing anything on the website itself .\", \\' The transcript API uses the video id to return a transcript because every youtube videos id is unique so we extract the  video id over here using url dot split equal to and then we get this returns a string of . This returns a list of strings and the in element at index one is the id that we want then we call the summary function .\\', \" Cript function it is returning the transcript to me once i have the transcript i\\'m passing in this whole transcript to the get summary function . This is an http code 200 that means the request was successful you may have heard of error 404 error 404 basically means the page wasn\\'t found .\", \" For the whole transcript i want to join all of them so i\\'m joining all of those various strings with a space so that i get one long string of transcripts and then i return the transcript . i pass it into the get summary function which gets me the summary and if you and uh so uh the way that so now we can move on to the actual summarizing and for the summarizing we aren\\'t really implementing the whole summarizing model ourselves .\", \\' The transformers summarization model has a limitation it can only provide the summary of a piece of text that is smaller than 1000 characters . To avoid that what we do is we break up our string into multiple parts of thousand and then we run the summarizing summarizer separately on each of those parts of thousands characters and then combine all of them to create one giant summary .\\', \" For i in range this much i\\'m doing summary text this is part of the summary not the whole summary i\\'m running summarizer and the in the summarizer i have to pass in what transcript i want right so i\\'m passing in summarizer transcript and then just the substring of the transcript . This is a feature in python called string slicing this lets me take sub parts of a string .\", \\' The way we do this is access summary . and it returns the title so what we want here is the summary . The summary is equal to summary plus summary text plus a space this look and then this repeats itself for how many of our parts the transcript has and remember we divided into it into parts earlier because we want it in parts of thousand characters .\\', \\' Pop-up popup.html is the whole design this is where i design you know the text the buttons so i have a title youtube transcript summarizer . Be sure you do this carefully or your extension may or may not work in . h for privacy purposes and security purposes .\\', \\' The extension is called popup.js and when this popup.html is created when the layout of the whole thing is created it also calls popup .js which starts our extension and puts it into action . This is the script because while the .html defines the . layout of our extension the . popup .javascript file it defines the logic of our . extension .\\', \" The button to check if a user has clicked the button this id output is what we\\'ll be requiring to put the you know the summarized output into the paragraph let\\'s move on to the actual logic of how i have coded this whole of how the extension works . The function that we check for is a click and then this is everything that happens when the button is clicked .\", \" Using this chrome feature called chrome dot tabs dot query we get using this feature . We need to get the url of the youtube video so that we use it to get using the chrome feature . All of these you don\\'t remember even i don\\'t know what each and every feature is you can just go through the chrome documentation .\", \" This is our server  127.0.1 colon 5000 and this is what i\\'m running locally so if you go to app dot py and let\\'s say you so run this file uh you\\'ll get your server over here running on http 127  \\\\xa0http 127 .\", \" XML http request dot open open open is the function to start a new request and the request is a get request obviously because we want to get a summary and this is the URL of the request .
